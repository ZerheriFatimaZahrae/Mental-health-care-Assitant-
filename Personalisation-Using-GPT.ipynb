        "# Fine-tuning Llama2 for Mental Health Counseling\n",
        "Approximately 1 in 4 adults in the United States struggle with a diagnosable mental disorder each year per estimates from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. While there are many mental health resources and professionals available, there is a lack of on-the-spot guidance that can set individuals towards the right therapeutic direction. Thanks to advancements in artificial intelligence and large language models, we now have the tools to craft such a virtual assistant. This notebook outlines the development of a preliminary prototype: we utilize a 7 billion parameter Llama 2 model, employ quantization for memory and training efficiency, and subsequently fine-tune it using Huggingface's Amod/mental_health_counseling_conversations dataset tailored for mental health Q&A. To bring this assistant to life, an in-notebook user interface is created for interaction.\n",

        "The trained model is accessible on Huggingface under langecod/CounselLlama7B."

Meta's Llama 2 stands out in this regard, offering a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) that span from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. The Llama 2-Chat variant is especially tailored for dialogue applications, demonstrating superior performance over other open-source chat models in various benchmarks and human evaluations for both helpfulness and safety. This made the 7 billion parameter Llama 2-Chat model an ideal choice for our prototype. Additionally, to address memory constraints, expedite training, and ensure cost-effective operations, we employed a version of the model with 4-bit weights and activations through quantization."

        "Training a quantized, generative model shares similarities with training other LLMs, such as BERT and Big Bird, but there are crucial differences to consider:\n",
        "1.  Typically, 1-3 epochs are sufficient to fine-tune the model for specific tasks. Overtraining can lead to overfitting, where the model might restrict its responses to the training set and not fully utilize the vast knowledge from Meta's pretraining dataset.\n",
        "2.  The model requires inputs that are a concatenation of prompts, contexts, and outputs, aiming to predict the outputs based on both the prompt and the context. For Llama 2, it's essential to maintain a consistent format that aligns with Llama's original pretraining:\n",

        "{{message}} [/INST] {{answer}} </s>\n",
        "```\n",
        "3. The prompt plays a pivotal role in shaping the bot's response. A less descriptive prompt can result in inappropriate or even potentially harmful responses, especially when discussing sensitive subjects like mental health. It's crucial to draft prompts that steer the model towards producing empathetic, helpful, and non-judgmental replies. Our goal is for the model to guide users towards suitable resources and techniques rather than making diagnoses or prescriptions.\n",

        "\n",
        "A simple chatbot user interface was set up using Ipywidgets so that the user can interact with the model, ask mental health related questions, and sample the responses. In general, the responses are pretty on topic, are non-judgmental, empathize with the user, and are helpful without stating its advice as prescriptions. I've noticed that the model also tends to refer the user to real resources and websites, which is always a concern with LLM hallucinations. However, there are some major issues. For one, the sentences are generally short, simple, and may even be redundant or repetitive at times. This is to be somewhat expected, as we are using a 4 bit quantized version of the weakest model available, and upgrades should alleviate these issues. Hallucinations also occasionally occur in the responses, especially when the input is unexpected. For instance, when the input is blank, I've observed the model make out-of-pocket statements such as the model suffering through sexual harrasment and emotional abuse growing up... Future iterations should pay due diligence with prompt improvements and response parsing, in addition to leveraging a more powerful model, to help mitigate these issues."

              "\n",
              "Before we dive into some specific strategies, I want to remind you that if you're feeling suicidal or having thoughts of self-harm, please reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for support. You can also call a crisis hotline or text the Crisis Text Line at 741741 in the US for immediate help.\n",

              "1. Deep breathing exercises: When we feel stressed or anxious, our breathing can become shallow and rapid. Taking a few moments each day to practice deep breathing can help calm your body and mind. Try inhaling for a count of four, holding your breath for a count of four, and exhaling for a count of four.\n",
              "2. Physical activity: Exercise can help reduce stress and anxiety by releasing endorphins, which are natural mood-boosters. Find an activity that you enjoy, whether it's walking, running, yoga, or dancing, and make it a regular part of your routine.\n",
              "3. Mindfulness meditation: Mindfulness meditation involves focusing your attention on the present moment, without judgment. You can practice mindfulness by paying attention to your breath, body sensations, or the sensations of the present moment.\n",
              "4. Journaling: Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process and release them. Try writing for a few minutes each day, focusing on what you're grateful for, what's bothering you, or what you're looking forward to.\n",
              "5. Connecting with others: Social support is essential for managing stress and mental health. Make an effort to connect with friends and family, or join a support group to connect with others who are going through similar experiences.\n",
              "6. Creative expression: Engaging in a creative activity, such as painting, drawing, or playing music, can help you express your feelings and emotions in a healthy way.\n",
              "7. Time management: Poor time management can contribute to stress and anxiety. Try prioritizing your tasks, setting realistic goals, and taking breaks throughout the day to help manage your stress levels.\n",
              "8. Gratitude practice: Focusing on what you're grateful for can help shift your perspective and reduce stress and anxiety. Try keeping a gratitude journal or sharing three things you're grateful for with a friend or loved one each day.\n",
              "\n",
              "Remember, these are just a few examples of coping mechanisms that can help with depression, anxiety, and stress. It's important to find what works best for you and to be patient with yourself as you explore different strategies.\n",
              "\n",
              "It's also important to remember that these coping mechanisms are not a replacement for professional help. If you're struggling with persistent symptoms of depression, anxiety, or stress, it's important to seek help from a mental health professional. They can provide you with the tools and support you need to manage your symptoms and improve your overall well-being.\n",

        "This notebook covered the fine-tuning of a 7 billion parameter Llama 2 model for the purpose of mental health counseling, utilizing a dataset consisting of Q&A pairs from counselchat.com. This was made possible through quantization, low rank adaptation and crafting prompts to suit the specific requirements of mental health interactions. A chatbot interface implemented via Ipywidgets also facilitated user interaction and evaluation of model responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are some areas for improvement though. The model sometimes produced brief, repetitive, or even hallucinatory responses. This can be linked to the constraints of using a 4-bit quantized, smaller version of the Llama 2 model. An upgrade can help enhance its performance. Furthermore, refining our prompt designs and enhancing response processing can enhance the model's effectiveness. As we look ahead, our goal is to enrich the dataset with varied sources, ensuring a more comprehensive response system. Although our current setup is rudimentary, envisioning a UI centered around user needs, complete with features like tailored exercises and coping strategies, can significantly uplift the user interaction and benefits."
